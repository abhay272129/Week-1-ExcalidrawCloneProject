General Guidelines:
Should you encounter challenges while working on the Excalidraw, feel free to seek guidance from the mentors or your instructor to navigate through the difficulties.
Though the project is structured across three weeks, if you find yourself with extra time on any given day, you are encouraged to continue working on the project. There's the potential to complete the project ahead of the stipulated deadline.
Your progress will be reviewed at the conclusion of the 2nd and 3rd weeks. Based on these reviews, constructive feedback will be provided to ensure you are on the right trajectory towards successfully building the clone.
